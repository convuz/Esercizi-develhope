# Again let's keep talking on Animal class we have.
# with 3 methods we just reached the number of legs
# to prevent direct interacting with the class variables
# most of the other programming languages have encapsulation.
# But in python we don't have it instead we use _ prefix for it as convention
# it is also same for the methods

# _legs this shows us not to touch this variable its up to you if you want to change it you can but _ asks you politely not to do it.

# Change the number_of_legs to conventional private variable and call from another method
